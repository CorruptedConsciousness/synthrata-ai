# Synthrata AI  
### Creating a dual-persona agentic assistants with a security-first design (Clyde & Bonnie)

Synthrata AI;s evolving, privacy-focused assistant system is built around a **dual-persona architecture**:

- **Clyde** — the analytical, security-hardened sentinel  
- **Bonnie** — the supportive, conversational guide  

Together, they form an agentic system capable of secure local workflows, counter-surveillance tasks, automation, and expressive personality-driven interaction.

This project represents my long-term flagship system — the one I intend to evolve for years.

# 🔥 Core Concepts

### **Local-first AI tools**
- Offline-capable workflows  
- Local LLM support  
- OS-level integrations  
- Command-line autonomy  

### **RAG Memory Architecture**
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
- Multi-level memory:  
  - short-term  
  - long-term  
  - encrypted local store  
- Structured conversation logs for context recall  

### **Security-Hardened Design**
- Zero-cloud requirement  
- Counter-surveillance workflows  
- System monitoring  
- Encrypted configuration  
- Observable / explainable actions  

### **Persona-driven UX**
Each assistant behaves differently:

**Clyde (The Sentinel)**  
- stoic • hyperlogical • investigative  
- cybersecurity + workflow automation  
- CLI-first  
- precise, terse, tactical  

**Bonnie (The Guide)**  
- friendly • witty • supportive  
- conversational teaching + motivation  
- helpful explanations  
- user-facing personality + emotional intelligence  

### **Future GUI + IoT Integration**
- Magic Mirror UI (Raspberry Pi 5)  
- Hardware sensors  
- Audio interaction  
- Desktop widgets  
- Intelligent workstation agent

# 🎯 Project Goals

Synthrata aims to unify:

- A **security-focused command-line assistant** (Clyde)  
- A **conversational, supportive personality layer** (Bonnie)  
- Local and cloud inference options  
- RAG-based reasoning pipelines  
- IoT integrations and hardware endpoints  
- Fully local encrypted memory  

This repository serves as the central development hub for the entire system.
