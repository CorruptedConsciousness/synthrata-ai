# Synthrata AI

An evolving, privacy-focused, agentic assistant system built around a dual-persona architecture (Clyde & Bonnie).  
Designed for counter-surveillance workflows, secure personal automation, and experimental human-AI interaction.

## 🔥 Core Concepts

- **Local-first LLM tools** (offline-capable workflows)
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and memory recall systems
- **Security-hardened assistant design**
- **Personality-driven UX models**
- **CLI prototypes for Clyde**
- **Future GUI + IoT integrations (Magic Mirror, Pi setups, sensors)**

## 🧩 Project Goal

Synthrata aims to unify:
- A security-focused command-line assistant (Clyde)
- A conversational, supportive personality layer (Bonnie)
- Local and cloud models
- RAG pipelines
- Hardware endpoints (Magic Mirror, Pi 5, workstation assistants)

This repo will act as the central hub as the system evolves.
