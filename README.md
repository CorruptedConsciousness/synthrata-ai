# synthrata-ai
Early development of an agentic counter surveillance assistant duo (Bonnie & Clyde).

- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Secure assistant design and privacy-focused architecture
- Personality-driven UX
- CLI prototypes and future Python integrations

This repo will serve as the project hub as Synthrata evolves.
